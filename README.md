**PLEASE NOTE**  
You will need to update those darn pointers in the MainJNI.cpp file  
located in the lib folder. Then save it and create a shared dll. The  
name of the dll should be "cant_touch_this.dll". Java will do the rest ;)

**ANOTHER NOTE**  
In case you are trying to build/compile this yourself, in the "main" cpp  
file, I made all the function names "functionF". This is for basic obfuscation  
against VAC. Although, overwatch did get me banned. So be carefull kids.

# TriggerBot for CS:GO (64 bit / windows only)

Very simple triggerbot for CSGO using Java &amp; C++  
No doubt this needs alot of work. It seems to crash sometimes;  
it's best to load this when you are already ingame. If you're having  
trouble launching this, or building it into a jar, just let me know  
via email. Thanks.

**Here is the example images**
